Their YouTube video on Keplerian orbits:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t89De819YMA  
- really high quality
- sadly missing details on stuff like the longitude of ascending node
- they only support elliptic orbits and not open trajectories
- ...sadly it's been privated :/

- to the point
- kinda beginner-friendly
- a lot of the matrix transformation code is derived from here

and their extensive references to scientific papers, especially those listed below,
which I used as a reference for improvements upon the eccentric anomaly
algorithm.

## Daniele Tommasini and David N. Olivieri
